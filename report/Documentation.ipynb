    "The scientific report aims to present the essential aspects of a recommender system down to the mathematical basics. The individual steps from the creation of an interaction matrix, similarity matrix to the prediction of a rating for items that a customer has not yet purchased are included. The basis is a dataset which contains transactions of customers. For each transaction information of User Id, Product Id, Order Id, Department of the product, Aisle of the product and if the product has been ordered before are available."

    "### Procedure\n",
    "A recommender can be created in several ways. There are two basic procedures. Model-based and memory-based. This document focuses on memory based recommenders which predicts a rating for products using an interaction and similarity matrix. Memory based recommenders can be further divided into two categories. Item based collaborative filtering (IBCF) and user based collaborative filtering (UBCF). The procedure is the same for both. With the help of the list of transactions an interaction matrix is created which records the interactions (in our case orders) for each item for each user. On this basis, a similarity matrix is created which records the similarity of two products in a numerical value. With the interaction matrix and the similarity matrix a prediction matrix can be created, which has basically the same structure as an interaction matrix, but predicts a rating for each user for each product not yet purchased. Based on this prediction, products can then be recommended. Using various metrics, mathematical and heuristic, a recommender is then evaluated. Different methods for calculating the individual matrices can be applied. A comparison is given at the end of the report or under Result."

    "A recommender is used to suggest products that a user has not yet interacted with, based on their personal preferences. The recommender learns these preferences by orienting himself on the previous interactions of the user and with the help of which he creates a user profile (Model based recommender) or searches for similar users and items (Memory based recommender). Recommenders are best known in online shops. Amazon shows products that 'may interest you' or Netflix suggests movies that you 'might like' based on your personal interests. These systems are of great importance to help customers find what they are looking for as quickly as possible. With a huge product shelf like Amazon has, a customer is dependent on it because it is impossible for them to find products they are not familiar with. There are two distinctions here. Firstly, a recommender can help the customer to discover new things and show them new, unknown preferences. The recommender thus helps the customer to 'explore'. Second, a recommender can also 'exploit' the known preferences of users to recommend products that match the known preferences.  "

The customers with more than n orders are suitable for further processing. The transactions of these customers can be recorded in an **interaction matrix** $I$ with the dimension $user \\times item$.

An item-item matrix defines the collaborative filter as item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) and a user-user matrix defines it as user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) because the first is looking for similar items and the second for similar users. Not every similarity function is applicable to a UBCF _and_ an IBCF. For example, Pearson correlation is best suited for user-users, i.e. a UBCF, where Cosine similarity gives the best results for item-item, i.e. an IBCF. For example, if we work with an IBCF, we can use the similarity function cosine similarity to determine the similarity $s$ of two items. Cosine similarity works with the intermediate angle function and thus calculates the similarity $s$ vectorized. Since the resulting matrix $S$ is symmetric only the upper or lower triangular matrix has to be calculated: (Three of several methods are described in detail in section 3.4.) "

The information from the prediction matrix can then be used to suggest new items to a user. It is also possible to recommend items directly from the similarity matrix $S$.
